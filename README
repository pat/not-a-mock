= notamock

A cleaner and DRYer alternative to mocking and stubbing with RSpec.

http://notahat.com/notamock/

== A Quick Introduction

=== Mocking (Not)

When you're setting up for a spec, you can ask that method calls on an object be recorded:

  object.track_methods(:name, :length)
  
Once your code has run, you can make assertions about what methods were called, what arguments
they took, their results, etc.

  object.should have_received(:length).without_args.and_returned(42)
  object.should have_received(:name).twice
  
See Notamock::Matchers for an explanation of the available assertions, plus
Object#track_methods and Object#untrack_methods.
  
=== Stubbing

==== Stubbing Methods

You can replace a method on an object with a stub version like this:

  object.stub_method(:method => return_value)
  
Any call to +method+ after this will return +return_value+ without invoking
the method's usual code.
  
Calls to stub methods are recorded as if you had called +track_methods+
on them, so you can make assertions about them as shown above.
  
See Object#stub_methods, Object#unstub_methods.

==== Stubbing Objects

You can also replace an entire object with a stub version like this:

  my_object = MyClass.stub_instance(:method_a => return_value, :method_b => return_value, ...)

The returned +my_object+ is a stub instance of MyClass with the given methods
defined to provide the corresponding return values.
  
See Object.stub_instance.

==== Stubbing ActiveRecord Instances

When you call +stub_instance+ on an ActiveRecord::Base subclass,
Not A Mock automatically provides an +id+ method and generates an
id for the object.

== Installation

(The following describes using Notamock with Rails. It should also be possible
to use it outside of Rails, but I haven't tried it.)

First, install the rspec and rspec_on_rails plugins:

  ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/CURRENT/rspec
  ruby script/plugin install http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/CURRENT/rspec_on_rails

(See http://rspec.info/documentation/rails/install.html for more details.)
  
Second, install the Notamock plugin:

  ruby script/plugin install http://svn.notahat.com/notamock/trunk

Finally, add the following to your project's spec/spec_helper.rb:

  config.mock_with Notamock::RspecMockFrameworkAdapter
